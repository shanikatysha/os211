# Top 10 List of _Week 09_

1. [**The popularity gain on cloud storage**](https://federalnewsnetwork.com/commentary/2017/03/5-reasons-use-cloud-storage-every-day/)<br>
Material storage drives aren't really used anymore due to the innovation of cloud storage. Before this happened people used social networks like Facebook and Twitter to exchange files, but now they can use their personal cloud storage to access files from any gadget and any place. Other than that, you can collaborate easier and create backups with no effort using cloud storage.
2. [**Common problems on harddrives**](https://recoverit.wondershare.com/computer-problem/common-hard-drive-problems-and-solution.html)<br>
Another reason to not use material storage drives. "Hard drive not found", this happened to me when I wanted to store my older files on a 1T harddrive and my laptop couldn't detect it. Turns out it was because of a security reason and that my laptop needed permission if an external storage wanted to connect with my laptop and it took much effort to finally make it work.
3. [**Booting on Operating System**](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~pxk/416/notes/02-boot.html)<br>
An operating system is usually stored as a collection of files on a computer disk and they way to run this "first program" is to use a boot loader. A boot loader is a program who's job is to run a bigger program that is the os. Once the boot loader han done it's job, it will transfer control to the os and from there the os will initialize itself and configure the system hardware such as setting up memory management.
4. [**The RAID**](https://techterms.com/definition/raid)<br>
This is not The RAID of the film, but RAID which means Redundant Array of Independent Disks. RAID is a method for storing data on multiple hard disks. When the Disks are stacked in a RAID configuration, the computer will see them all as one large disk. However, they operate much more efficiently than a single hard drive. Because data is spread across multiple disks, read and write operations can be performed on multiple disks at the same time. Which means, it can significantly speed up hard drive access times.
5. [**Swap Space Management**](http://www.faadooengineers.com/online-study/post/ece/operating-systems/1172/swap-space-management)<br>
When the physical memory reaches it's limit, the processes are moved from the memory to swap space to free some available memory. This is calles a swap space management, another low-level task of the operating system. Virtual memory uses disk space as an extension of main memory. Because disk access is much slower than memory access, swap space usage significantly degrades system performance. The primary goal of swap space design and implementation is to provide the best performance for the virtual memory system.
6. [**MBR vs GPT**](https://www.tembolok.id/panduan-gpt-vs-mbr/)<br>
A storage media / drive cannot be directly used by the operating system before it is formatted and the type of system partition to be used is determined. MBR (Master Boot Record) and GPT (GUID Partition Table) are partition systems, these systems are used by operating systems such as Windows and Linux to manage the data contained in them. MBR and GPT have the same function, namely to manage storage media such as HDD, SD, flash, etc. GPT was made after MBR and supports more partitions, bigger storage, and safer thus why people use GPT these days rather than MBR. The GPT partition system is also used as a standard partition for new UEFI firmware in place of the BIOS and is a system partition that supports today's modern hardware.
7. [**GRUB on Linux**](https://itsfoss.com/what-is-grub/)<br>
GRUB is a common bootloader on linux. GRUB is acronym for GRand Unified Bootloader. If you think editing a file with a text editor in the terminal is not something you feel comfortable with, you can use a graphical tool called GRUB Customizer. Accessing the GRUB documentation in your Linux terminal can be done using the info grub command.
8. [**UEFI and BIOS**](https://www.howtogeek.com/56958/htg-explains-how-uefi-will-replace-the-bios/)<br>
Similar case to MBR and GPT on partition system, UEFI and BIOS are low-level software that starts when you boot your PC before booting your operating system. It's responsible for waking up your computer’s hardware components, ensures they’re functioning properly, and then runs the bootloader. However, UEFI is a more modern solution, supporting larger hard drives, faster boot times, more security features and—conveniently—graphics and mouse cursors.
9. [**NVM**](https://techterms.com/definition/non-volatile_memory)<br>
Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) are all semiconductor technologies that do not require continuous use of power supply to store data or program code stored in computing devices. One example of NVM that we often hear is Read-Only Memory (ROM), Flash Drive, Hard disk drive, Solid state drive, and Optical media (CDs, DVDs, etc).
10. [**Disk Scheduling**](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-disk-scheduling)<br>
As we know, that a process requires two types of time, CPU time and IO time. For I/O, it asks the operating system to access the disk. However, the operating system must have a sufficient level to meet every request. At the same time, the operating system must maintain the efficiency and speed of process execution. Thus, the technique the operating system uses to determine which requests to fulfill is known as disk scheduling.
